# KristianFJones/PrometheusStarLink

This is a monitoring stack using OPNSense and Network Exporter, I've created this stack for my setup, and StarLink, but in theory any muliWAN OPNSense setup with the rest of my setup would work.

## Setup

TODO

## Hosts

Add two hosts entries for

```
127.0.0.1 prometheus.int.example.com grafana.int.example.com
```
